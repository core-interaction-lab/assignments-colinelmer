		<h2>Things Behind the Sun</h2>
		<p>Please beware of them that stare
			They'll only smile to see you while
			Your time away
			And once you've seen what they have been
			To win the earth just won't seem worth
			Your night or your day
			Who'll hear what I say.
			Look around you find the ground
			Is not so far from where you are
			But not too wise
			For down below they never grow
			They're always tired and charms are hired
			From out of their eyes
			Never surprise.
			Take your time and you'll be fine
			And say a prayer for people there
			Who live on the floor
			And if you see what's meant to be
			Don't name the day or try to say
			It happened before.
			Don't be shy you learn to fly
			And see the sun when day is done
			If only you see
			Just what you are beneath a star
			That came to stay one rainy day
			In autumn for free
			Yes, be what you'll be.
			Please beware of them that stare
			They'll only smile to see you while
			Your time away
			And once you've seen what they have been
			To win the earth just won't seem worth
			Your night or your day
			Who'll hear what I say.
			Open up the broken cup
			Let goodly sin and sunshine in
			Yes that's today.
			And open wide the hymns you hide
			You find renown while people frown
			At things that you say
			But say what you'll say
			About the farmers and the fun
			And the things behind the sun
			And the people around your head
			Who say everything's been said
			And the movement in your brain
			Sends you out into the rain.
